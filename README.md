# Practice_Patterns_Assessment_Study


We seek to characterize Glaucoma practice patterns and adherence to American Academy of Ophthalmology’s Perferred Practice Patterns for open angle glaucoma practitioners in academic vs. non-academic settings.

In particular, we will report the frequency** of, and counts*** of patients in the universe who have received the specified procedures in the code.

Additionally, we will report: 
  -a breakdown of medications utilized
  -the time intervals between follow-up visits

We will also be reporting the number of patients in the universe who have E&M codes and “eye codes”.

Finally, we will report the baseline and one-year VA, IOP, and CTD values

We will be testing for significant differences between academic and non-academic groups using a Chi-square test, two-sample t-test, or an appropriate nonparametric test.

Demographic and Clinical Covariates:

Continuous variables (i.e. reporting mean, SD, median, IQR, min-max):
Age
Number of visits per patient

Discrete/factor variables:
Index year 
Insurance
Race
Provider region
Gender
Smoking status
